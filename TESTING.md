## BUGS

### Known Bugs

As far as I'm aware, there are currently no known bugs.


### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I resolved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The photo in the "Why Cut With Me" section had a lot of space on the right. | To fix this, I added a container on top of the image which allowed me to crop the right side of the image to look how I wanted it to. |
| 2 | The format of the "About" page kept breaking between 752 - 500px. | In order to fix this, I needed to add additional media queries and adjusted the format for these resolutions. |
| 3 | The format of the "Contact" page kept breaking between 1550px - 1200px. | In order to fix this, I needed to add additional media queries and adjusted the format for these resolutions. |
| 4 | The header was causing certain pages to have a horizontal scroll. | In order to fix this, I needed to remove the padding that was present as this, combined with width:100%, was causing errors as the header would take up a bit more room than what it should. I also added a margin:0 auto; to then center the logo in the middle of the page. |
