## User Experience (UX)

I wanted to make it an easy game to understand and play but hard to master.

#### Key information for the site
* How to play

#### Client Goals
* To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
* To be able to learn how to play.
* To see my score.
* To see the leaderboard.
#### First-Time Visitor Goals
* I want to play a game on the web
* I want to learn how to play the game and what my goal is 
* I want to easily tell what my score is
#### Returning Visitor Goals
* I want to try and beat my high score
* I want to listen to the game sounds
* I want to play on my mobile instead of pc
#### Frequent Visitor Goals

## Design


### Colour Scheme
![colour pallet](https://github.com/VitorBarbosaDev/EndlessRunnerGame/assets/46977318/6da3138a-67c1-4788-a586-9c55b282aabd)


I wanted a cool and easy-to-read colour scheme so I decided to go with a white background for the game have obstacles be red and green and have the body background be a sky gradient 

I created the pallet above to represent the colours used on the website [coolors](https://coolors.co/)



### Imagery

All the games players and obstacles were drawn onto the screen using the canvas

### Sounds

All the sounds were gotten from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/library-of-game-sounds) and the reason these specific sounds were chosen was that they gave off the right vibe of calming yet frustrating 

### Wireframes

## Features


### Home Page.
* The website consists of a single page.
* This page has a canvas which contains an endless runner game where players compete to get the highest scores
* There is also a button that allows players to unmute
* There is a button that allows players to go fullscreen (Note: This used to fullscreen the canvas also but I felt it gave bigger screen players an unfair advantage so I made it just fullscreen the window)
* There is a how-to button that shows players how to play
* There is a leaderboard button that displays top scores and players can scroll
* There is also an input box that allows players to input their name so if they get a high score they can show their friends

#### Future Implementations.

* In the future I may implement different characters or colors to game
* I may also implement different obstacles as the code for doing so is already in the game

#### Images to show responsiveness

### Accessibility

I adhered to all the recommended guidelines for accessibility. Here's what I implemented:
* Utilized semantic HTML for better structure and understanding.
* Added information for screen readers to allow them to read that the browser does not support canvas
* Ensured a sufficient colour contrast across the site for better visibility.
